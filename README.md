# AI Agent Architecture
### An architectural approach and design patterns for building AI Agents

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, the development of intelligent Agents stands at the forefront of innovation. These sophisticated systems, capable of perceiving their environment and taking autonomous actions, are poised to revolutionize industries and transform our daily lives. This article delves into a proposal for an intelligent agent architecture that using the key techniques and methodologies.

Throughout this article, we will explore the typical AI agent process, highlighting best practices for each module within the architecture. From perception and reasoning to action selection and execution, we'll provide insights into optimizing each component for peak performance.

It might be helpful to define terms commonly used to refer to generative AI use cases in the market.

**AI agents** are designed to perform specific tasks, answer questions, and automate processes for users. These agents vary widely in complexity. They range from simple chatbots, to copilots, to advanced AI assistants in the form of digital or robotic systems that can run complex workflows autonomously.

**Copilots** are a type of AI agent. They work alongside users rather than operating independently. Unlike fully automated agents, copilots provide suggestions and recommendations to assist users in completing tasks.

**Agent architecture** defines the organizational structure and interaction of components within software agents or intelligent control systems, commonly referred to as cognitive architectures in intelligent agents. 

AI Agent are composed of several interconnected components that work together to enable intelligent behaviour. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall functioning of the AI system, and they must interact seamlessly to achieve desired outcomes. The image below show each **Core Components of AI Agent**.

**LLM-based agents** are software systems that string together multiple processing steps, including calls to LLMs, in order to achieve a desired end result. Agents typically have some amount of conditional logic or decision-making capabilities, as well as a working memory they can access between steps.
