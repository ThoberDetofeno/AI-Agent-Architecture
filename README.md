# AI Agent Architecture
### An architectural approach and design patterns for building AI Agents

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, the development of intelligent Agents stands at the forefront of innovation. These sophisticated systems, capable of perceiving their environment and taking autonomous actions, are poised to revolutionize industries and transform our daily lives. This article delves into a proposal for an intelligent agent architecture that using the key techniques and methodologies.

Throughout this article, we will explore the typical AI agent process, highlighting best practices for each module within the architecture. From perception and reasoning to action selection and execution, we'll provide insights into optimizing each component for peak performance.
